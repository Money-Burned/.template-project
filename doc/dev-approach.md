# Development approach of [your-repo-name]

## Framework or development platform used

- Origin and some background on the chosen framework/platform
- Links to further literature (official documention / Wikipedia)
- What knowledge one should already have when choosing this framework/platform?
- Cost and license considerations in the context of the framework/platform

### Method of approach

- Why that framework?
    - Common benefits and/or disadvantages
    - Limitations ("only works on befor high noon and below 20 degrees")
- Are there any dependencies on the operating system and if not, what do you have to consider if you want to run it on different operating systems?
- Are there any dependencies on other software in your code, e.g. libraries that you use?
- How much time should a developer plan to use your approach?

### Development Environment

- How do you set up a modern development environment for optimal development processes?
- Tools of choice

## Planning and software design

### Requirements

- What did you do to map the requirements to specific tasks to implement?
- Did you use user stories or requirements or both?
- To what extent have you broken it down?
- What requirements did you end up implementing?

| OB 03.1 | No | |
| OB 03.2 | No | |

- What special features that were not part of the requirements did you include and why?

### Modeling of data

- Outline the class model of the application if you use OOP; feel encouraged to use graphics like UML
- Outline the persistence of your application if it is implemented; feel encouraged to use graphics like ERM

### Logic

- Outline how your internal processing is designed; feel encouraged to use graphics like flow charts or a state diagram!
- Did you externalize parts of your logic and why?

## Tutorial

Please write a guide on what steps a developer who is completely new to this framework/platform needs to do to build this or a similar application themselves.

## Some words about this file

In this document you can explain everything about your journey to create this software. Whatever it takes - just make sure that an interested reader is able to understand what you've done so far and how.  

I would be appreciated if you could at least briefly explain the above points.
